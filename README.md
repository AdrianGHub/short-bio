## Brief 

I am a **third-year _IT student_**.  I've recently participated in student exchange in the
summer semester of 2018/19. Until mid-June, I studied at **Riga Technical
University**, on the degree of Computer Science. 👨‍🎓
This exchange allowed me to develop my **skills in the use of English**, especially in
the field of science I've chosen. 
The experience I gained during my current education at school, university and
through systematic self-education using 21st-century goods will certainly
contribute to meeting the expectations of the employer at the internship I am
looking for.   
Independent learning develops in me a **sense of responsibility** for entrusted
responsibilities, **diligence and reliability**. In addition, I am a **contact person, kind,
open to suggestions for new ideas and solutions**. I bravely accept the challenges
posed to me, I can notice the consequences of mistakes and draw appropriate
conclusions from them for the future.  
These features have a positive impact on the environment of people with whom I
live, both during work and in my free time. With my determination, I can prove in
practice that the position I apply to corresponds to the range of skills I
have.

PS 😉  

In my spare time I'm also in love with powerlifting 🏋️‍♀️ ukulele rythms 🎸 and cooking🥧
